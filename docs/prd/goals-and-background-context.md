## Background Context

This portfolio site serves as a comprehensive professional showcase for a senior engineering candidate with expertise spanning multiple technical and business domains. The current landscape requires engineering candidates to demonstrate not just technical implementation skills but also strategic thinking, business acumen, and cross-functional capabilities including marketing. This site addresses that need by presenting carefully curated projects that highlight both depth and breadth, with an emphasis on measurable impact and real-world problem-solving.

The target audience—hiring managers, recruiters, and technical leads—needs to quickly evaluate candidates across multiple dimensions. By combining project filtering, clear technology visualization, and accessible contact methods, this portfolio streamlines that evaluation process while maintaining a professional, cohesive first impression.
