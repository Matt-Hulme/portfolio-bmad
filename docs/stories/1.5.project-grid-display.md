# Story 1.5: Project Grid Display

## Status

**Completed**

---

## Story

**As a** portfolio visitor,

**I want** to see all projects displayed in an attractive, scannable grid,

**so that** I can quickly browse the portfolio and identify projects of interest.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Project card component created using shadcn Card
2. Card displays: project title, one-line summary, role badges, technology line
3. Role badges use shadcn Badge component with appropriate styling
4. Technology line shows comma-separated tech stack (truncate with ellipsis if too long)
5. "Alive" link indicator shown for projects with live URLs (icon or badge)
6. Grid layout is responsive (1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 3 columns desktop)
7. Cards have hover state indicating they are clickable
8. All 7 mock projects render correctly in the grid
9. Grid is visually balanced and professional
10. React Testing Library tests verify card rendering and data display

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Grid Layout Strategy** [Source: Epic 1, AC 6]
- Mobile-first responsive design
- 1 column on mobile (< 768px)
- 2 columns on tablet (768px - 1024px)
- 3 columns on desktop (> 1024px)
- Tailwind classes: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`

**Card Design Principles**
- Clear visual hierarchy (title → summary → metadata)
- Scannable at a glance
- Interactive feedback on hover
- Left border accent for visual interest
- Consistent spacing and typography

**Technology Display** [Source: AC 4]
- Join technologies with ", " separator
- Truncate if longer than 60 characters
- Add "..." to indicate truncation
- Ensures cards maintain consistent height

### Component Structure

```typescript
// ProjectCard.tsx
interface ProjectCardProps {
  project: Project;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

export function ProjectCard({ project, onClick }: ProjectCardProps) {
  // Display logic
  // - Title
  // - Summary
  // - Role badges
  // - Technology line (truncated)
  // - Live badge (conditional)
  // - Hover state
  // - Click handler
}
```

```typescript
// ProjectGrid.tsx
interface ProjectGridProps {
  projects: Project[];
  onProjectClick?: (project: Project) => void;
}

export function ProjectGrid({ projects, onProjectClick }: ProjectGridProps) {
  if (projects.length === 0) {
    return <EmptyState />;
  }

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      {projects.map(project => (
        <ProjectCard
          key={project.id}
          project={project}
          onClick={() => onProjectClick?.(project)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Visual Design Details

**Card Styling:**
- Background: `bg-gray-900/50` with backdrop blur
- Border: Left border with primary color accent
- Hover: Darker background, elevated shadow, enhanced border
- Padding: Consistent internal spacing
- Border radius: Rounded corners for modern look

**Role Badges:**
- Use shadcn Badge component
- Variant: "secondary"
- Multiple badges wrap to next line
- Gap between badges for visual separation

**Technology Line:**
- Small text size for secondary information
- Gray color for hierarchy
- Truncation prevents layout breaking
- Max length: 60 characters before ellipsis

**Live Badge:**
- Distinct "outline" variant
- Only shown for projects with live links
- Positioned for easy scanning

### Accessibility Features

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Cards are keyboard focusable (tabIndex={0})
- Enter and Space keys trigger click
- Focus indicators visible

**Semantic HTML:**
- Proper heading hierarchy
- role="button" for interactive cards
- Alt text considerations (handled in Card component)

**Screen Reader Support:**
- Descriptive text for all interactive elements
- Proper labeling of badges and indicators

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library):**
- ProjectCard tests verify rendering and interaction
- ProjectGrid tests verify layout and data flow
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Mock project data for consistent testing

**Test Coverage:**
- All props and variants tested
- Keyboard interaction verified
- Empty state tested
- Responsive classes verified

### Coding Standards [Source: architecture.md#16.1]

**React:**
- Functional components with TypeScript
- Named exports (not default)
- Props interfaces defined
- Optional props with `?` notation

**Styling:**
- Tailwind utility classes
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use `cn()` helper for conditional classes
- Consistent spacing scale

**Component Organization:**
- Components in `src/components/projects/`
- Tests colocated with components
- Clear separation of concerns
