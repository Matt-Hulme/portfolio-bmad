SW 2,Star Wars Archive 2,,"Rebuilt my first solo Star Wars archive app one year later, showcasing growth in React, TypeScript, and modern front-end practices.
","### Overview  
When I started learning front-end development, I built a simple Star Wars archive app (V1) to practice React. Almost a year later, I rebuilt it (V2) to measure how much I’d grown. The project acts like a Star Wars “pokedex,” letting users browse films, characters, planets, starships, and more.  

### Improvements from V1 → V2  
- **TypeScript vs JavaScript**: V2 fully typed for better maintainability.  
- **Responsive Design**: V2 optimized for mobile; V1 was desktop-only.  
- **Data Layer**: V2 used GraphQL (all data at once); V1 used Fetch + pagination.  
- **Styling**: V2 used TailwindCSS; V1 relied on a single monolithic CSS file.  
- **Component Libraries**: V2 integrated Material UI; V1 was fully custom-built.  
- **Reusable Components**: V2 introduced shared components (e.g. `DetailsHeaderPanel`) to reduce duplication.  
- **Routing & Params**: V2 improved URL handling and navbar highlighting.  
- **Error Handling**: V2 added styled 404 and “not found” pages instead of Vercel defaults.  
- **Design Choices**: V2 adopted a cleaner design (less border-radius overuse).  

### Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, Vite
- **Data Layer:** GraphQ
- **UI Library:** Material UI
- **Deployment:** Vercel  


- Currently, the GraphQL endpoint used by V2 has lost support, so some detail queries return null fields :'(",,FE Dev,https://starwars-archive.vercel.app/ (graphql endpoint broken),https://github.com/Matt-Hulme/starwars-archive,,,,,

Brainstormer,Brainstormer,,An AI-powered creative assistant that generates related or overlapping concepts to spark new ideas.  ,"### Overview  
Brainstormer is an AI-powered ideation tool designed to help users explore creative connections between concepts. By entering one or more topics, the system would use a large language model to generate either related ideas (OR mode) or overlapping connections (AND mode). The goal was to support writers, entrepreneurs, and creatives in unlocking new directions during early brainstorming.  

Though my brother and I eventually closed the project after early user testing, it was one of the most enjoyable and ambitious builds I’ve worked on, combining modern front-end development with AI integration and custom backend services.  

### Features  
Users could:  
- Enter one or more **concepts** to generate new, related ideas  
- Switch between **“OR mode”** (connections to either concept) and **“AND mode”** (overlapping aspects of both)  
- Explore generated lists of concepts and refine their brainstorming process  
- Interact with a lightweight, responsive interface optimized for creative flow  

### Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, Vite  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, Python-Multipart, Uvicorn  
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API  
- **Deployment:** Dockerized and hosted on a private VPS  

### Notes  
- This was one of my most **fun experimental projects**, intended as a real business concept.  
- Early testing provided valuable lessons on product-market fit, prompting us to pivot away.  
- Still, Brainstormer served as an important project for sharpening my **AI integration skills** and full-stack deployment experience.
